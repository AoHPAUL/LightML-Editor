**Light ML Editor**

Light ML Editor is designed to help create quick websites with the click of a few buttons or writing a bit of LML shorthand. I have tried to add a whole list of inserts and prebuilt components into the editor to both teach people how to use LML shorthand and allow the rapid building of web pages.

**Key Features**

The editor has a few key features to help users build what they want:
- Split screen or quater screen preview allows for a live representation of what you are doing. The quater screen closely mimics a mobile setup.
- The preview is live and updates on change. A javascript function manages the update in the background.
- Menus have been added to help users save/open files, add elements to a page or use a the prebuilt templates to build their dream web page.
- The editor supports multiple themes in the settings menu to try and help visually impared users.

The editor supports inserts. This will directly write the LML into the editor for you for you to edit with your own values.

Other themes exist on the editor for those users that prefer different colours.
