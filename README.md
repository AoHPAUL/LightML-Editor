**Light ML Editor**

Light ML Editor is designed to help create quick websites with the click of a few buttons or writing a bit of LML shorthand. I have tried to add a whole list of inserts and prebuilt components into the editor to both teach people how to use LML shorthand and allow the rapid building of web pages.

**Key Features**

The editor has a few key features to help users build what they want:
- Split screen or quater screen preview allows for a live representation of what you are doing. The quater screen closely mimics a mobile setup.
- Menus have been added to help users save/open files, add elements to a page or use a the prebuilt templates to build their dream web page.
- The editor supports multiple themes in the settings menu to try and help visually impared users.
